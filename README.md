This twitterbot was inspired by Brandon Morelli's @BrandonMorelli article: 
https://codeburst.io/build-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-in-just-38-lines-of-code-ed92db9eb078

This project was created to seek justice, and for myself to learn about Twitter's API, and not to take revenge on anyone. 
For this reason, I will not mention the company at fault anywhere.
